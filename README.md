# Koha-Christmas-Themes
Some CSS themes that can be used to customise your OPAC for the Christmas period! See our blog post on the topic for more information.

All of these themes can be plugged directly into your OPAC by using the OPACUserCSS and OPACUserJS system preferences in your Koha client. Simply copy and paste these files into the input fields provided under each preference and the styles will import automatically into the OPAC.

Once copied into your Koha system, feel free to modify these in any way you see fit.

Here are examples for each one:

<ins>Snowfall</ins>

<ins>Snowfall (responsive)</ins>
Just like snowfall, except the snowflakes respond to your mouse movements or if you tilt your phone screen!
